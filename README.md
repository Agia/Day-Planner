# Day Planner

## Description

[**View Demo**](https://agia.github.io/Day-Planner)
</br>
</br>
A simple calendar app for scheduling your day.

The app runs in the browser, dynamically updating the HTML and CSS using jQuery, allowing the user to input events by the hour, and save those inputs so that they are not lost on page refresh.

The app also provides basic color-coding to indicate whether the event is past, present or future, of the current time.

## Usage

You can use the app directly via it's Github Pages deployment (found [**here**](https://agia.github.io/Day-Planner) or by using the `View Demo` link above).

Below is a gif showing the app in use:
